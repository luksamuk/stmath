# stmath
First version of math/geometry library for Studium Engine

**## Purpose
There is none. This is the first version of libstudium's math library, along
with a macros header, which I created for implementing vector and matrix
operations. This was before I knew a C port of GLM existed (CGLM). Now that I
knew of it, I simply gave myself a vacation from implementing this kind of math
from scratch.

## License
Like libstudium, this old portion of it is distributed under the LGPL v3.0
license.
